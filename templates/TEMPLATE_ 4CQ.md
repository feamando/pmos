1. **Who is the primary customer?** The primary customer is the most important and most direct beneficiary of the solution you are proposing. What is their relationship to Acme Corp or the project. Other customers may be mentioned here or they can be listed in the future FAQs. Describe them. Be specific about them, what they want/need, their behavior, and the qualities that make them our target.

2. **What is the customer problem or opportunity?** What is the specific customer situation/context we are trying to address? Describe their pain, the impact and consequences of a problem. Describe the current state/situation of an opportunity. It needs to be realistic, objective and plausible. You want everyone to understand and compare the degree of improvement that the solution brings. How do we know this is a problem? Do we have any evidence to support our hypothesis? Qualitative or quantitative. What makes us confident that we understand the customer's needs or wants? If none exists, how might we test our hypothesis.

3. **What is the solution? What is the customer experience?** What is the solution to the customer problem/opportunity that you are proposing? How do you think it should work? Be descriptive, specific and detailed. Help the reader understand the approach, perhaps alternatives considered and why this is the right one. This is not about design but about the form, location, methods and processes you intend the customer to encounter.

4. **What is the most important customer benefit?** The most important benefit is the thing that this solution does that matters most to the customer.  Typically, we save the customer time, money, or increase selection or make things easier. Help the reader understand what this customer cares the most about and how this solution addresses this. Additional benefits may be mentioned or added to future FAQs.
