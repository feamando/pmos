**Document Guidelines:**

These guidelines mirror the structure and clarity of the Yearly Plan documentation to ensure the Tribe's 2-Pager is treated as a serious, strategic planning document focused on cross-functional alignment.

1. **What is the purpose of this document?** The Quarterly Tribe-Level Update document is intended to surface systemic friction points encountered in the previous quarter and to cascade the Tribe’s most critical goals and to Central Functions and other Alliances. It summarizes the Tribe's tactical priorities and explicitly calls out cross-functional commitments required for successful Q1-2026 execution.  
2. **Who owns this document?** The 2-Pager document is owned by the respective Tribe Lead. The Tribe Lead is responsible for ensuring the content accurately reflects their Tribe’s performance, technical reality, strategic intent, and required external commitments.  
3. **How long do you expect the Market Yearly Plan document to be? T**he Tribe Q4-2025 Review and Q1-2026 Alignment document, including all mandatory sections, must be no longer than two (2) full pages. No appendices are permitted. The document must be immediately scannable and digestible by senior leadership.  
4. **What are the mandatory sections?** All sections detailed in the template (Q4-2025 Review, Systemic Blockers, Learnings, Q1-2026 Roadmap, Dependencies, and Hot Debates) are mandatory and must be answered concisely.  
5. **What is the deadline for submission of the Market Yearly Plans?** The Friday prior to the start of the Quarterly Planning Offsite  
6. **How to submit my Yearly Plan Document?**  Your Yearly Plan Document must be sent via email by the Tribe Lead to Brian Leung, who will add it to the formal Quarterly Planning Offsite so that all participants can read them prior to the sessions.

## 

## **I. \[Insert Tribe Name\]’s Executive Summary of Q4-2025 Performance**

\[This section must clearly state the Tribe Name and the overarching Mega Alliance it belongs to. The primary Tribe Mission should be captured in a single, succinct sentence. Quantify the Tribe’s most critical Q4-2025 Key Metric/OKR Outcome by stating the final performance result achieved versus the original target (e.g., Target: $5\\%$ reduction in latency; Result: $3.5\\%$ reduction). Finally, include a brief 1-2 sentence statement on the Tribe's Strategic Relevance to the overall company mission and revenue generation.\]   

## **II. Deep Dive of Q4-2025 Systemic Blockers**

\[Elaborate on the most damaging Top 3 Systemic Blockers encountered in the previous quarter. These blockers must be rooted in external dependencies involving Central Functions (e.g., Finance, Legal) or other Tribes, and should not focus on internal resourcing issues. Conclude this section with a concise Root Cause Analysis paragraph explaining why the blockage occurred, focusing on process gaps, data misalignment, or policy ambiguity.\]

## **III. Key Learnings and Failure Analysis**

\[Synthesize the Top 3 Key Learnings acquired during Q4-2025, focusing on new knowledge or insights related to market dynamics, technology limitations, or organizational friction. Crucially, detail the Tribe's Mitigation Plan by explaining how your internal process will be actively changed in Q1-2026 to preemptively minimize the impact of these past issues, even if the external dependency itself remains challenging.\]

## **IV. Q1-2026 Goals and Roadmap**

\[This section must clearly articulate the Tribe's strategic direction and execution plan for the upcoming quarter. Detail the Tribe's Top 3-5 Key Projects or Key Feature Roll-Outs for the upcoming quarter. These goals must be precise and measurable. Use the table format below to list out these goals as well as any critical dependencies
